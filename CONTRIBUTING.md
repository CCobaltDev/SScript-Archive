# Contributing to the archive

If you have a missing version and you wish to contribute to the archive, follow these steps.

- Collect the haxelib.json, README.md, source folder and other files into the zip root
- Rename the zip to this **specific format**: `SScript-VERSION.zip`.
The version must have `,` (commas) and no `.` (dots).
- Move the zip into the `archives` folder on this repository
- Create a pull request and explain which versions you added
    
    If the version is a modified version of yours, make sure to add trailing information, like how mobile versions have `-mobile` at the end of their name.
