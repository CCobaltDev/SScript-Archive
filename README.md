# SScript-Archive

Archived versions of SScript, a Haxe Script library, so Psych Engine and other projects can be developed and compiled.

## Installation Instructions

### Via the included Python script (Recommended)

- Download the script `install.py`
- Install the dependencies `pip install requests`
- Run the script `python install.py 21.0.0`

### Install manually

1. Select a version from [the list](https://github.com/CobaltBar/SScript-Archive/tree/main/archives) and download it with the download button
2. Move this zip into your source directory
3. Go into your source code directory, open a terminal and write `haxelib install ZIPNAME.zip`

## Troubleshooting
### For manual instructions
**IF** moving SScript to your source directory creates more problems than it solves, run `haxelib remove SScript` in the same terminal/current working directory where it was installed

Follow these steps:

- Run `haxelib config` in the same terminal/current working directory and remember this path
- Open a new terminal at this path, navigate to it and open it using the taskbar, whichever way you prefer.
- Perform the install command there, with the file present in that directory.

If you are still getting the "SScript is not available, thanks to everyone for their support" message, make sure you read the instructions correctly.

### For Python script

Please watch a YouTube video on how to use Python. It is extremely simple.
